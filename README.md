# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Summary

With this project the student is required to demonstrate proficiency using the Google Maps API and manipulating that data with Python DataFrames. The student will prompt the user to input data by using an input statement. The student will write a script that uses the user input data to filter potential travel destinations and nearby hotels based on the users weather preferences. From the list of potential travel destinations the student will write a script that chooses four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, the student will create a script that plots a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
